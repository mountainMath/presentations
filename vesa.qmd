# Population over time

```{=html}

```

Vancouver has grown since the 70s, but it hasn't grown uniformly. Where has population grown, when, and by how much?

# Population by age
```{r}
age_pyramid_styling <- list(
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=c(seq(0, 100, 5),"100+")),
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma),
  coord_flip(),
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1"),
  theme_bw(),
  labs(caption="StatCan 2021 census"))
```

```{r fig.height=4}
cancensusHelpers::get_age_data('2021',list(CSD=c("5915022","5915025","5915004","5915055"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Population, fill = Gender)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  facet_wrap("`Region Name`",nrow=1, scales="free_x") + age_pyramid_styling
```

Very different shapes of age pyramids in different cities in the region. How does this happen? 

# Net migration 
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
People move. A lot. Almost 50% of the population in the City of Vancouver in 2021 lived at a different address in 2016. 

We can check what regions, on net, people of specific age groups move away from and what regions they tend to move to.

# Children in Vancouver
Children are in indicator species. If policies work for children, they probably work for almost everyone.
