## Modelling SSMUH and TOAs


:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Overview over modelling work to estimate effects of provincial SSMUH and TOA policies.

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Goal of modelling:

*   estimating build out of housing due to SSMUH and TOA policies
*   estimate effects on housing prices (and rents)
*   run across a broad range of assumptions, e.g. demand growth, size of supply effects, etc

*   broad socio-economic outcomes
*   some specific question, e.g. effect of enhanced renter protections in TOAs

# SSMUH

Guidelines from ministry:

* allow 4 units on every lot
* 6 within the frequent transit network
* around 50% lot coverage, 3 stories

We broadly interpreted this as allowing up 1.5 FSR, enabled through outright development with short approval timelines. At grade parking. Approval time of a month or two.

# TOAs

Guidelines from ministry:

* list of transit stations
* annular buffers with prescribed minimum allowable densities

We modelled this as wood frame for up to 3 FSR areas and concrete for above 3 FSR, with underground parking. Approval times between 1 and two years depending on form.


## How to model policy impact?

::: {.column .incremental width="30%"}
*   For each eligible parcel and year, estimate development profitability, probability of availability for redevelopment. 
*   Incorporate demand growth scenarios and feedback for multiplex/apartment sale prices (supply effect) and land prices (increasing multiplex/apartment land scarcity).
*   Iterate every year.

## Price model

## Cost model

The cost model assembled data and estimates for 

*   hard costs for 
    -   relevant building typologies 
    -   at different construction quality levels 
    -   in different parts of the region
*   soft cost
*   contingencies
*   profit expectations
*   financing
*   land costs (possibly with assembly premium)
*   development charges
*   other applicable taxes

## Development option

## How to model redevelopment?

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
#### SSMUH{.center}

Parcels randomly come up for sale at rates similar to historical rates.

When they do, check development potential based on value of existing use vs expected multiplex sale prices and determine probability of redevelopment.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### TOA{.center}

Development on existing low density parcels might require assembly of neighbouring parcels (selling at a premium). 

Development of higher density parcels is idiosyncratic and difficult to predict.

Assume a variety of ACC/IZ scenarios in determining profitability and redevelopment probability.

:::
::::

Total redevelopment is capped by labour market capacity. Modelled to expand in size (and productivity) similar to New Zealand.


## Metro Vancouver estimates

Estimated effects of SSMUH and TOA policies on Metro Vancouver over 10 years:

*   Around 140,000 to 174,000 net new dwelling units expected above business as usual (13% and 16% increase in stock)
*   The added housing supply is expected to suppress prices between 10% and 30% below BAU scenarios

. . .

### Assumptions and caveats

*   Assumes fast approval times
*   Assumes faithful implementation of SSMUH with minimal ACCs is any
*   Assumes ACCs set to keep development in TOAs broadly viable to encourage development
*   Interest rate changes may affect shorter term projections
*   SSMUH and TOA zoning is not optimal, it leaves some areas under-zoned and is (currently) not viable in others
*   ... (more in the report)

## Metro Vancouver context

How does this relate to growth, who is going to move into those new homes?

:::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}


![](images/mhu-share-rent.svg)


:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

::: {.incremental}

*   Vancouver has high rates of doubling up, people pool resources to make housing work.

*   People double up in response to high rents/prices, and rents/prices are set by the richest doubled-up family or individual looking to live on their own.

*   Improving housing outcomes means to build enough homes to allow families and individuals to better distribute over housing.

Household formation in Metro Vancouver peaked in 1981 and steadily declined since.
