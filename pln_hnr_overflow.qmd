## Some history

US has nice long timelines to estimate household formation.

## Canadian history
Similar trends in Canada, household formation peaked in 1980 in most of Canada.

## What changed?

In Vancouver we downzoned most of the city in the 1970s and transitioned to a highly disretionary planning system. At the regional level we transitioned from planning to accommodate growth to planning to "manage" growth.

Discretionary planning systems remove or heavily reduce the ability of the market to repsond to demand signals. In it's place we took a planning economy approach.

## Planning for scarcity

This approach to planning for housing is fundamentally flawed and systematically leads to housing shortages.

## How much housing do we need to avoid doubling up?

::: {.column width="60%"}

::: {.column width="40%"}
An upper bound is when every minimal household unit has their own home.

Québec metro area suggests that some doubling up is voluntary and not necessarily a sign of a housing shortage.

## Unravelling shortages (sliding down the demand curve)

We can again relate this to rents and estimate how adding housing reduces doubling up.

*   To reduce doubling up in Vancouver to the same rates seen in Montréal, we need 16% more housing while keeping the population fixed.
*   This would reduce rents by about 35%, but that would likely increase in-migration and lower out-migration, so population would not be fixed and the actual reduction in rents would be less.

# Central insight

::: {style="font-size: 1.3em;text-align: center;margin:40px;"}
Households are **outcomes** of housing affordability. 
:::

This has important implications for planning.

. . . 

Household-based metrics like Core Housing Need or shelter-cost-to-income ratios are blind to the impact on household formation. ("Collider bias")


Example:

* 30 year old living with parents lives in *very* affordable housing, the combined household income of parents and 30 year old is likely high compared to their running shelter costs.
* If 30 year old moves out and rents a place, they may well be stretched for shelter costs. But their life (and their parent's) likely materially improved, otherwise they would not have moved out.

. . .

Focusing *too much* on household-based metrics can lead us to wrong conclusions.

## How should we deal with housing shortages?

Doubling up ain't so bad, neighbourhood character matters more!

## Targets are a bridge

Targets help get us back on track. Soon municipalities will have to ensure there is enough **outright zoning** to accommodate 20 years worth of housing needs.
