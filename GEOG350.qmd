-   So much data!

-   Patterns in population growth

-   Income: choosing metrics

-   Children in Vancouver - making sense of patterns of change

-   The data generation process - the central question for any data analysis

# Population over time

```{=html}
<a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/html/yvr_pop_timeline_2021.html" target="_blank"><img src="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/posts/2024-04-23-population-timelines-update/index_files/figure-html/vancouver_pop_change_1971_2021-1.png"></a>
```
Vancouver has grown since the 70s, but it hasn't grown uniformly. Where has population grown, when, and by how much?

# Population by age

```{r}
age_pyramid_styling <- list(
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=c(seq(0, 100, 5),"100+")),
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma),
  coord_flip(),
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1"),
  theme_bw(),
  labs(caption="StatCan 2021 census"))
```

```{r fig.height=4}
cancensusHelpers::get_age_data('2021',list(CSD=c("5915022","5915025","5915004","5915055"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Population, fill = Gender)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  facet_wrap("`Region Name`",nrow=1, scales="free_x") + age_pyramid_styling
```

Very different shapes of age pyramids in different cities in the region. How does this happen?

# Net migration

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
People move. A lot. Almost 50% of the population in the City of Vancouver in 2021 lived at a different address in 2016.

We can check what regions, on net, people of specific age groups move away from and what regions they tend to move to.

# Income segregation
Your measure determines what you see.

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

![](images/cov_income_classification.png)
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

Average 2015 individual income relative to Metro average by 2016 place of residence, split into 

*   Very High (>1.4 times Metro average), 
*   High (1.2-1.4), 
*   Medium (0.8-1.2), 
*   Low (0.6-0.8), 
*   Very Low (<0.6).

# Children in Vancouver

Children are in indicator species. If policies work for children, they probably work for almost everyone.

# The data generation process

We have lots of data easily available to us. But too often do we jump to conclusions based on preconceived notions.

We need to pay more attention to the data generation process. What social and economic processes do we think underlay a given data series? Can we test if these theories are consistent with the data? Can we establish causal mechanisms?

# An (opinionated) perspective how to move forward

With so much data, and so much existing research, how do we move forward? Cities are complex systems, and identifying underlying demographic, social, and economic processes is hard. 

I put a strong emphasis on **reproducible** and **adaptable** work flows to ensure the analysis is **transparent**, can easily be updated as new data becomes available, and can be tweaked or adapted to address related questions.

This means to clearly describe methods and assumptions, use publicly available data sources whenever possible, and most importantly **share your code**!

Sharing your code makes it unequivocally clear what you did, it keeps you honest, and it allows others to build on your work. We need more and deeper data analysis and a wider range of people engaging in data analysis from a broad range of perspectives.

Different people bring in  different perspectives, make different assumptions and different choices in their analysis. Sharing your code makes it easy for others to build on your work, adapt it, and maybe even improve on it.
